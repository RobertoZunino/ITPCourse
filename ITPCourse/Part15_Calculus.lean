open Topology -- This enables the 𝓝 notation for neighborhoods

section General_note
/-
  Below, we will see a few proofs for a few familiar properties like
  continuity and differentiability, which are defined in the Lean libraries.

  Note, however, that the definitions found in the libraries might be more
  general than the ones you expect. Much more general.

  Continutity for a basic function `f: Real → Real`, for instance, is
  defined in terms of _topology_. A few theorems from the library must then
  be used to restate continuity in terms of distance in a _metric space_,
  and from there simplify the goal so to see the usual `ε` and `δ` property.

  Asymptotics (limits, Landau's little-o notation, …) is defined in terms of
  _filters_: these are families of sets that model "closedness" to a value.
  For instance the set of all neighborhoods of `x`, written `𝓝 x`, is a
  filter.

  Differentiability is also defined in very general terms, involving the
  Fréchet derivative, neighborhoods, filters, little-o notation, and more.
  Again, a few theorems from the library must be used to rephrase
  differentiability in more usual terms.

  Being very general is a common trend in the Lean libraries, which strive
  not to repeat the same proof in different contexts. This is accomplished
  by proving the most general statement and then add the common cases as
  corollaries.

section Continuity
/-
  Let's prove that a few basic functions are continuous.

  We start from a line `λ x => α*x + β`.

  Of course, its continuity can be solved with an automated tactic:
-/
example (α β: ℝ) : Continuous (λ x => α*x + β)
  := by continuity

/-
  Let's ignore the automation, and write an actual proof.

  Here we exploit several lemmas from the library. Remember you can search
  for them in several ways.
-/
theorem line_cont (α β: ℝ) : Continuous (λ x => α*x + β)
  := by
  -- This lemma provides the usual "ε and δ" criterion for continuity.
  apply Metric.continuous_iff.mpr
  intro x ε εpos
  by_cases α = 0
  case pos αzero =>
    subst α
    exists 1
    simp
    intro a h
    exact εpos
  case neg αnonzero =>
    exists (ε / |α|)

      exact abs_pos.mpr αnonzero
    . intro y h

      calc
      _ = |y-x| * |α|     := mul_comm _ _
      _ < (ε / |α|) * |α| := by gcongr
      _ ≤ ε               := by simp [αnonzero]
/-
  Above, `gcongr` takes a goal of the form
    `f x y z < f x' y' z'`
  and tries to reduce it to some properties of the arguments
    `x < x'`, `y < y'`, `z < z'`
  provided `f` is monotonic.
  It works on `<` but also on other relations such as `≤`, `=`, … .
  It also tries to close simple subgoals.
-/


/-
  We now prove that the sum of two continuous functions is continuous.
  (Again, without relying on the `continuity` tactic)

  In Lean, `+` uses a type class so it works on all numeric types. It also
  works on functions: `f + g` stands for `λ x => f x + g x`.

  functions is continuous.

section Asymptotics

section Filters
/-
  We start with some reasoning on _filters_. Filters are families of sets
  modelling "closedness" to something, and appear in many places when
  working with calculus (limits, little-o notation, …).

  Here are a few examples of filters and what they represent:
  - `𝓝 x` being close or even equal to `x` (neighborhood)
  - `𝓝[≠] x` being close but not equal to `x` (punctured neighborhood)
  - `𝓝[s] x` being close to `x` and inside set `s`
  - `Filter.atTop` diverging towards `+∞`
  - `Filter.atBot` diverging towards `-∞`

  Note that `𝓝[≠] x` is defined as `𝓝[{x}ᶜ] x`:
-/
example (x: Real)
  : 𝓝[≠] x = 𝓝[{x}ᶜ] x
  := rfl
/-
  Technically, a filter `F` is a family of sets such that
  - the whole real line belongs to `F`
  - if `a,b ∈ F` then `a ∩ b ∈ F`
  - if `a ∈ F` and `a ⊆ b` then `b ∈ F`

  You can verify that the families of neighborhoods mentioned above all
  satisfy these properties. (Note that `𝓝[s] x` is defined as the family of
  supersets of `s ∩ a` for some `a ∈ 𝓝 x`.)

  In practice, a filter is commonly used to state that a property `P x`
  holds "eventually", i.e. for all `x` "close enough according to the
  filter".

  For instance, the following proves "all `x` close enough to `0` are less
  than `1`"
-/
example
  : ∀ᶠ x: Real in 𝓝 0 , x < 1
  := by
  apply eventually_lt_nhds
  simp only [zero_lt_one]
/-
  More formally, `P` is true eventually on filter `F` iff
    `{ x | P x } ∈ F`
-/

/-
  As an exercise, we prove equality between the following filters.
  - `𝓝[≠] 0`, representing being close but not equal to `0`
  - `𝓝[ Set.Ioo (-ε) ε \ {0} ] 0` representing being close to `0` and inside
    the open real interval `(-ε, ε)` with the `0` removed

  Intuition suggests these are the same: being "close" to `0` according to
  one filter clearly implies also being "close" according to the other
  filter.

  We establish equality by proving the double inequality between filters
    `F₁ ≤ F₂ ∧ F₂ ≤ F₁`
  where `F₁ ≤ F₂` models the intuitive relation "if we are `F₁`-close, then
  we are also `F₂`-close".
  (Note that this means that if a property `P` holds when we are `F₂`-close
  enough, then `P` also holds when we are on the points `F₁`-close enough.
  It might be counterintuitive at first that the direction is reversed.)

  We start by proving the first inequality:
-/
theorem nhdsNE_le_nhdsWithinIoo
  (ε: Real)
  (ε_pos: ε > 0)
  : 𝓝[≠] 0 ≤ 𝓝[ Set.Ioo (-ε) ε \ {0} ] 0
  := by
  apply nhdsWithin_le_iff.mpr
  simp [ nhdsWithin , min , Filter.instInf ]
  exists Set.Ioo (-ε) ε
  constructor
  case left =>
    apply Ioo_mem_nhds
    case ha =>
      linarith
    case hb =>
      exact ε_pos
  case right =>
    exists {0}ᶜ

/-
  The equality of filters then follows by antisymmetry and a library lemma.
-/
theorem nhdsNE_eq_nhdsWithinIoo
  (ε: Real)
  (ε_pos: ε > 0)
  : 𝓝[≠] 0 = 𝓝[ Set.Ioo (-ε) ε \ {0} ] 0
  := by
  apply le_antisymm
  case a =>
    exact nhdsNE_le_nhdsWithinIoo ε ε_pos
  case a =>
    apply nhdsWithin_mono
    simp

/-
  Here is an example of strict inequality between filters: approaching `0`
  from the right implies approaching `0`, but not vice versa.
-/

section Limits
/-
  We now study a limit, proving that the function
    `λ x => 1 / |x|`
  tends to `+∞` when `x` approaches `0`.

  Since we don't want to evaluate the function at `0`, we chose `x` to be
  close to the filter `𝓝[≠] 0` (and not just `𝓝 0`). The result the function
  tends to is instead `+∞`, i.e. the filter `Filter.atTop`.

  `Filter.Tendsto` is the the relation for limits:
